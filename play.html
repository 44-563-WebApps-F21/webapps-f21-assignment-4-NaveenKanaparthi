    <p class="speech">
    He can't be serious there. What is the use of the people
    except to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you 
    must really let me have forty thousand roubles to-morrow? my wife says 
    she must have a new diamond bracelet.</p><br>

    <h5>COUNT R</h5>
    <p class="speech">Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave
    her last week, I suppose.</p> <br>
    
    <h5>PETRO</h5> <br>

    My dear General, your nephew must be a perfect Turk. He 
    seems to get married three times a week regularly<br>

    <h5>GEN. KOT</h5><br> 
    Well, he wants a dowry to console him<br>

    <h5>COUNT R</h5> <br>
    I am sick of town. I want a house in the country<br>

    <h5>MARQ. DE POIV</h5><br>
    I am sick of the country. I want a house in town<br>
