    <p class ="speech">He can't be serious there. What is the use of the people
        except to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you
        must really let me have forty thousand roubles to-morrow? my wife says
        she must have a new diamond bracelet.</p><br>

    <h4 class="countr"> COUNT R </h4><br>

        her last week, I suppose.</p><br>

    <h4 class ="princepetro"> PRINCE PETRO </h4><br>

    seems to get married three times a week regularly</p><br>

    Well, he wants a dowry to console him<br>
